      All trials should be published, with their full methods and results made
      available. The WHO <a class="external"
      href="http://www.who.int/medicines/ebola-treatment/data-sharing_phe/en/"
      target="_blank">recently stated</a> that this process should be expedited
      during public health emergencies. However, there is currently no public
      data describing which individual researchers and organisations are
      complying with these ethical requirements. The Ebola Trials Tracker aims
      to fix this. We identify every trial on Ebola, and then highlight each
      individual trial that has currently not reported results. This is a
      complex task: researchers are required to place important information
      about their trials on public trial registries, but they often fail to do
      so, or leave incorrect information in the public domain. We therefore
      encourage all users of this site to read our paper to learn more about our
      methods.
    </p>
    <p>
        Below we present information on all completed trials (and ongoing trials
        with preliminary results). We also present summaries of our
        correspondence with trialists. If you are aware of any trial results we
        have missed, you can tell us here. You can also see the raw data behind
        this site, including ongoing trials, here. For this site, we consider
        preliminary and grey literature results to count as “reported”: however
        a more detailed breakdown is available in our paper. To maintain ongoing
        monitoring of compliance we will run results searches, and update the
        data presented here, on a monthly basis from February 2017.
